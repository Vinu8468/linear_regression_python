# Linear Regression from Scratch (Python)

This repo contains a simple implementation of "ordinary least squares (OLS) Linear Regression"

 - Calculate slope (m) and intercept (c)
 - Predicts new values

   m = (nΣxy - ΣxΣy) / (nΣx^2 - (Σx)^2)
   c = (Σy - mΣx) / n  

More detailed documentation will be added soon.
